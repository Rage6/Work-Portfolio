          I was born and raised in rural Ohio, and I earned my bachelor’s degree in Life Sciences at the <a href="https://alumni.westpointaog.org/FindaGradDisplay?reid=XzWqzO%2fD6XsJeyx65rd0NA%3d%3d&bbsys=0&bbrt=0" target="_blank">United States Military Academy</a>. I was commissioned as an Army officer in 2010 and specialized infantry leadership in 2011. Shortly after that, I was deployed to Afghanistan and <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/2013/03/29/lieutenant-journeys-back-from-the-dead-how-more-than-300-troops-rallied-to-save-one-soldier/" target="_blank">sustained extensive combat injuries</a>. I underwent a long recovery and was medically retired as a Captain in 2015.<br><br>
          My interest in website development began soon after leaving the military, and this simple hobby gradually turned into a passionate career. I officially plunged into the website development field in 2017 by attending an immersive, 3-month long website developer “boot camp” from <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>.<br><br>
          As short as this training was (in comparison to traditional, college-level education), the training from GA was intense and thorough as our instructors fully explained both the front- and back-end sides of website development for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. In addition to learning some good, fundamental technical skills, this difficult course earned me two important realizations. First, it confirmed that I genuinely love programming, which I had wondered since my college degree from West Point was related to chemistry and biology rather than computer sciences. Second, it proved to me that I was a genuine programmer now, in spite of my disabilities.<br><br>
          However, I quickly realized that the GA training was not the “finish line” if my ultimate goal was to get a web developer job. My physical limitations and inability to drive restricts me to remote/work-at-home job opportunities. That, coupled with my lack of on-site programming experience, seemed to make each and every one of my job applications quickly ignored.<br><br>
          I then sought out additional online training regarding any fundamental, server-side skills, in hopes that it would prove the depth of my knowledge in website development. This is why I earned a 4-course long, non-credit <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-applications" target="_blank">web application specialization</a> by University of Michigan in 2018. This great, highly-detailed, and self-paced training allowed me to fully examine and understand every aspect of each and every lesson. This training, in combination with my GA training, finally helped me reach the point where I could build and secure a robust full web application with battle-tested server-side languages/tools that I had never attempted before: PHP, SQL, and MySQL.
